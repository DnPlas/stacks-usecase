## Intel System Stacks Usecases

The Clear Linux* OS  based [reference stacks](https://github.com/intel/stacks) allow developers to quickly get up and running with images tailored, optimized, and tested together for specific use cases. This repository offers example use cases to explore the possibilities.

The first End to End use case uses the [Data Analytics Reference Stack](https://clearlinux.org/stacks/data-analytics) and the [Deep Learning Reference Stack](https://clearlinux.org/stacks/deep-learning) to walk through a classification example, using data from GitHub* to show how Machine Learning can analyze and tag new issues to save time for developers who are creating issues, and to ensure the issues come to the attention of the right audience through correct tagging.

Look for more use cases to come soon.
